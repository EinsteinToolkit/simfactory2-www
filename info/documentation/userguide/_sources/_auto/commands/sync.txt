.. _command_sync:

sync
================================================

*sync cactus sourcetree to a remote machine*



Usage
-----

sim sync [options] [ *machine* ]

  Synchronise local Cactus source tree to *machine*.  The first time
  this operation is performed, it can take some time as all the source
  is copied.  Subsequent calls will only synchronise the files which
  have changed.

  You can control exactly what is synced by creating a file
  simfactory/etc/filter.local.rules which is used as an Rsync filter
  rules file (see "man rsync" for a description).

Options
-------
.. program:: sim sync

.. cmdoption:: --sync-path <path>

  Only synchronise a specific path

.. cmdoption:: --sync-parfiles

  Only synchronise parameter files

.. cmdoption:: --sync-sourcetree

  Only synchronise the source tree
