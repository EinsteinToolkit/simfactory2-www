Performing large three-dimensional time-dependent simulations is a complex numerical task. Managing such simulations, often several at the same time as they execute on different supercomputers, is comparable to herding cats â€” supercomputers differ in their hardware configuration, available software, directory structure, queueing systems, queuing policies, and many other relevant properties.

<br>

However, these differences are only superficial, and the basic capabilities of supercomputers are very similar. The simulation factory contains a set of abstractions of the tasks which are necessary to set up and successfully finish numerical simulations using the Cactus framework. These abstractions hide tedious low-level management tasks, they capture "best practices" of experienced users, and they create a log trail ensuring repeatable and well-documented scientific results. Using these abstractions, many types of potentially disastrous user errors are avoided, and different supercomputers can be used in a uniform manner.
